Each personnel number is unique
Each lab has a single lab code
Each research project has a single code and supervisor
Each member of the personnel may work on one or more research projects
Personnel names need not necessarily be unique
Research code, description and supervisor are repeating fields



UNF   DB(person_no, person_name, birth_date, lab_code, lab_name, research_code, research_descr, research_supervisor)

all entities are in one relation. 


1NF   DB(person_no, person_name, birth_date, research_id, lab_code, lab_name)
      R1(research_id, research_code, research_descr, research_supervisor)
      
single values in every column (atomic), primary keys which identify every value in the tables
      

2NF   DB(person_no, person_name, birth_date research_id, lab_code)
      R1(lab_code, lab_name)
      R2(research_id, research_code, research_descr, ressearch_supervisor)
 
all rules of 1NF compliant, all non-key columns are dependent on the primary key of each table, create foreign keys


 3NF  DB(person_no, person_name, birth_date)
      R1(person_no, research_id, lab_code)
      R2(lab_code, lab_name)
      R3(research_id, research_code, research_descr, research_supervisor) 
      
all rules of 2NF compliant, all non-key columns should be DIRECTLY dependent on primary key of each table
